<h1>Project Proposal</h1>
<p>A written proposal can make a lasting impression on a client and should be used frequently. Proposals include specific details which vary quite a bit based on the individual project. However, there is a fairly standard structure for the proposal document itself. Most proposal documents follow a fairly standard structure, though specific structure can vary based on the individual project and designer. Most proposal documents include:</p>

<ol>
<li>A description of the scope of work and specific objectives for this project, meaning need that must be met and the targets that must be hit.</li>
<li>Your work process including descriptions of your design phases, milestones, sequence of steps, deliverables, number of comps, included revisions, timeframes, client responsibilities, format for delivery, etc.</li>
<li>A schedule of fees, taxes, total fees and expenses, recap of the milestones and total timeframe.</li>
<li>A schedule of billing, detailing invoice amounts and when they happen during the project.</li>
<li>Chose either the <a href="/contracts/full-terms-and-conditions">Full Terms & Conditions</a> or <a href="/contracts/condensed-terms-and-conditions">Condensed Terms & Conditions</a>.</li>
<li>Signature lines.</li>
</ol>

<p>Itâ€™s also a good idea to include a line inviting the client to follow-up with you and to show a willingness to revise or negotiate the scope of work, if needed.</p>

<h2>Instructions on using a Project Proposal</h2>
<p>The Scope of Work should include an introductory paragraph summarizing what is to be done. The rest of the Scope of Work should describe the phases and milestones of project development. If the client is not familiar with the design process, include an explanation of what you are doing at each phase and when the client will be given materials. Be as specific as possible when describing the project. Include detailed information about the nature and number of deliverables. Describe the project well enough to accurately convey the complexity of the proposed project.</p>

<p>Design work is typically billed in phases. For a flat-fee project, it may be best to break the fee out by design phase. It will be easier to collect fee for work completed, if the project is canceled.</p>

<p>Include either the <a href="/contracts/full-terms-and-conditions">Full Terms & Conditions</a> or <a href="/contracts/condensed-terms-and-conditions">Condensed Terms & Conditions</a>.</p>

<p>Include a cover letter, on your letterhead, when presenting a client with a Project Proposal. In it, mention the source of your contact, your availability and time constraints, and invite further discussion of the proposal. Keep it short and sweet.

<blockquote>"Dear [Potential Client],<br><br>[Contact], a friend of yours, recommended that I contact you about building a website for your business. [Contact] as explained the nature of your business and its website needs. I believe I can help. Please review the attached project proposal and feel free to contact me if you wish to discuss this project further.<br><br>Thank You,<br>Signed [Designer].</blockquote>

	<h2>Scope of Work</h2>
	<p>I will develop a completely custom website for Fancy Meats Co. The goal of this website is to provide Fancy Meats Co. with an online presence and to provide current and prospective customer vital information about Fancy Meats Co. business operations.</p>
	
	<p>The website will be a 5 page website consisting of the following pages: Home, About, Contact, Services, Profile. The home page will have text and pictures about Fancy Meat Co. The about page will give a company history. The contact page will have a form allowing customers to send an email to Fancy Meat Co. The services page will list services. The profile page will have a photo and profile for each of Fancy Meat Co.s 12 employees.</p>
	
	<p>The design process consists of four (4) phases: Concept, Design, Technical, and Testing. In the concept phase, I begin work by outlining the basic flow and gathering text and images for the website. In the design phase I create digital artwork for the outlined webpages and integrate the images and text. In the technical phase I enable the website server, domains and add interactive functionality like forms and emails. In the testing phase, I check the entire website to make sire it is operating as expected.</p>
	
	<p>This website will work in all Grade-A browsers. It will not be designed to operate on mobile devices.</p>
	
	<p>On the following pages, you will find a more detailed description of the project phases, timeline, due dates, deliverables and fees. You will also find a set of terms and conditions.</p>
