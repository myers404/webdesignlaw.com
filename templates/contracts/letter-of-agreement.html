<h1>Letter of Agreement</h1>
<p>The next time a client comes to you with a quick job, save yourself time and aggravation by sending them a quick Letter of Agreement to be signed BEFORE you start working. The letter is basically an abbreviated contract confirming the scope of the job, the schedule, fees to paid and essential terms and conditions. Use this style of contract for quick jobs or where a full-blown contract would make the client apprehensive.</p>
